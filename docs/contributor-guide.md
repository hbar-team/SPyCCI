# Contributor's guide

`SPyCCI` is an open source project and, as such, all the contributions are well accepted. If you want to contribute to the library, a simple guide on how to interface with the GitHub repository is provided in what follows.

## General development process

* If you are a first-time contributor:

    * Go to [https://github.com/hbar-team/SPyCCI](https://github.com/hbar-team/SPyCCI) and click the “fork” button to create your own copy of the project repository.

    * Clone the project to your local computer using the command (where `<YOUR_USERNAME>` represent your personal GitHub username): 
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/SPyCCI
        ```

    * Enter the reposiotry directory using the command:
        ```
        cd SPyCCI
        ```

    * Add the upstream repository using the command:
        ```
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/hbar-team/SPyCCI.git
        ```

    * Now, when running the `git remote -v` command, the following reposiotries shold be visible:
        * `upstream`, which refers to the SPyCCI repository
        * `origin`, which refers to your personal fork

* Developing your contributions:
    
    * Pull the latest changes from upstream:
        ```
        git checkout main
        git pull upstream main
        ```

    * Create a branch for the feature you want to work on. Since the branch name will appear in the merge message, use a sensible name.:
        ```
        git checkout -b the_name_of_the_branch
        ```

    * Commit locally as you progress (`git add` and `git commit`) and use a properly formatted commit message. If possible, write tests that fail before your change and pass afterward, run all the tests locally. Be aware that the whole suite of tests can be run using `pytest --cov`. More informations about testing can be found in the [dedicated section](testing-info). Before the commit use `tox` to verify the compatibility with all the supported version of python (`tox` will run only unit tests if executed using the provided `tox.ini` configuration file). Be sure to document any changed behavior in docstrings, keeping to the [NumPy docstring standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Sphinx annotation are very welcome. If brand new functionality are added to the package make sure to update the documentation as well.

* To submit your contribution:

    * Push your changes back to your fork on GitHub:
        ```
        git push origin the_name_of_the_branch
        ```
    * Follow the GitHub authentication process.

    * Go to GitHub. The new branch will show up with a green Pull Request button. Make sure the title and message are clear, concise, and self- explanatory. Then click the button to submit it.

    * Ask for review from the development team.

## Basics of local development

If you are new to developing python software we strongly advise you to create a local virtual environemnt using Conda or similar tools. Once you have done so, you can install the library in your environment entering, once inside the main `SPyCCI` folder, the command:

```
pip install -e .
```

This will install the python pacakge in editable mode making all the changes you have made immediately effective. To test the functionality of the library you can use the existing tests that can be run using `pytest`. To do so, you can install the development requirements using the provided `requirements_dev.txt`. To do so you can use the command:

```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

All the tests can be run using the command `pytest --cov` as explained above.

### More info about testing
Testing in the SPyCCI library has been divided into three categories:

* `unit`: All the tests related to the inner workings of the library, the object definitions and all the sanity checks concerning data integrity and interactions between class objects.
* `integration`: All the tests related to the interaction between `SPyCCI` and the calculation softwares. These test are intended to verify the correctness of the submitted calculations and the results obtained from the parsing routines.
* `functional`: All the rest related to the operation of composite functions involving one or more calculation software and further data processing by `SPyCCI` itself.

As such, `unit` test can be run without any third party software while `integration` and `functional` tests require the computational softwares to be available. 

:::{admonition} Third party software versions
:class: danger
For the current version of `SPyCCI` the following version of third party software are **required** for testing:

* orca `6.1.0`
* xtb `6.7.0`
* crest `3.0.2`
* dftb+ `24.1`
* packmol `20.14.2`

**Compatibility of the available test with other versions must be verified.**

:::

Specific test groups can be run explicitly by referencing the corresponding folder or script. For example, the command:

```
pytest tests/unit
```

will run only the unit tests, while the command:

```
pytest tests/integration/test_orca_integration.py 
```

will run only the integration tests for the ORCA engine.

If a specific test needs to be executed (e.g., for development purposes), it can be selected using the `::` syntax. For example, the command:

```
pytest tests/integration/test_orca_integration.py::test_cosmors_solventfile
```

will run only the `test_cosmors_solventfile` from the integration tests for the ORCA engine.

### `SPYCCI_VERSION_MATCH` environment variable

By default, the `spycci` library requires an exact match for version dependency, for example Orca 6.1.0 requires OpenMPI version 4.1.8. If any other version is found, an exception is raised and the program will stop running. This behaviour can be adjusted via the `SPYCCI_VERSION_MATCH` environment variable, by setting it to one of these options:

* `strict` (default): enforces an exact match between dependencies
* `minor`: allows the last version specifier for a given dependency to change (e.g., if OpenMPI 4.1.8 is requested by the dependency, any version 4.1.x will be accepted)
* `major`: enforces only major version match (e.g., if OpenMPI 4.1.8 is requested by the dependency, any version 4.x will be accepted)
* `disabled`: does not enforce any version check for dependencies. Users must ensure themselves software versions are compatible.

### Running tests via the Docker container

To simplify the testing procedure, we provide a Dockerfile with all the required third-party software in the specific versions used for development. The only current exception is Orca, for which users need to provide their own archive, downloaded from the [FACCTs](https://www.faccts.de) website or the [Orca Forums](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal).

To build the container, copy the `.tar.xz` archive with Orca (we recommend using version `6.1.0-f.0`) in the `SPyCCI` folder (the archive must be in the same location from which you launch the `docker build` command), and run:

:::{admonition} Note
:class: info
Depending on your environment, you may need to provide superuser privileges for running `docker` commands.
:::

```shell
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg ORCA_LOCAL_ARCHIVE=orca-6.1.0-f.0_linux_x86-64_openmpi41.tar.xz -t spycci:test .
```

After having built the container, you can run the test suite via the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm spycci:test
```

The `--rm` flag removes the container after the run; the image remains available. If you want to also remove the image (to list all available images: `docker images`), run:

```shell
docker rmi spycci:test
```

:::{admonition} Images vs Containers
:class: info
For those unfamiliar with Docker, think as a Container as an *instance* of an Image. Images are the "recipes", Containers are the "cakes". Images are immutable, read-only snapshots, Containers are the working implementation of the corresponding Image, with a writable (therefore, mutable) layer.
:::

To remove only the unused images (i.e., images not referenced by any container), run `docker image prune`.

It is also possible to run only a subset of tests and pass specific flags to the `pytest` command:

```bash
docker run --rm spycci:test pytest -vvv --color=yes tests/integration/test_xtb*
```

### Using Singularity instead of Docker

In HPC environments, Docker is often not available as it requires root privileges for building images. In its stead, Singularity (or its open-source version Apptainer) are usually found. The concept is identical, meaning that a containerized image containing the necessary software stack is produced, and that can be used to ensure reproducibility during development or in production environment.

Here we provide the Singularity counterparts for the Docker commands explained above. The explanations and comments can be used for either versions.

To build the container:

```shell
singularity build --sandbox --build-arg ORCA_LOCAL_ARCHIVE=orca-6.1.0-f.0_linux_x86-64_openmpi41.tar.xz spycci.sif apptainer.def
```

This will produce the `spycci.sif` container file, which can be run as:

```shell
singularity run spycci.sif
```

:::{admonition} Bind Paths
:class: warning
Singularity container are by default read-only, therefore calculations will normally fail as the container cannot write the results anywhere. For normal operations, the current directory should be mapped to `/workspace`; it is also recommended to mount the default scratch folder for your HPC environment. The following command runs the SPyCCI Singularity container, with write access to both the current directory and `/scratch_local`.

```shell
singularity run --bind ./:/workspace,/scratch_local spycci.sif
```

:::

:::{admonition} Bind Paths
:class: warning
Be aware that unlike Docker, modifications to bind paths are **permanent** and occur on the actual filesystem running the container.
:::

As with Docker, it is also possible to run only a subset of tests and pass specific flags to the `pytest` command:

```bash
singularity run --bind ./:/workspace,/scratch_local spycci.sif pytest -vvv --color=yes tests/integration/test_xtb*
```
