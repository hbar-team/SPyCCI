# SPyCCI User Guide

Version: [`0.0.1`](changelog)

This is the user guide for the **S**imple **Py**thon **C**omputational **C**hemistry **I**nterface (**SPyCCI**) Python pakage. The philosophy of this software package is that of providing the user with a simple unified interface to run computational chemistry calculations across multiple computational chemistry software backends. **SPyCCI** is more than a simple automation tool for the computational chemistry practitioner but rather a package aspiring to be a universal interface for routine calculations, high-trhoghput screenings, property calculations and methods benchmarking. **SPyCCI** not only gives to the user a convenient interface for using computational chemistry softwares but also provides the user with automated functions and workflow to manipulate molecules and compute properties and observables.
