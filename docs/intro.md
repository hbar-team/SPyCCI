# SPyCCI User Guide

Version: [`1.0.0`](changelog)

This is the user guide for the **S**imple **Py**thon **C**omputational **C**hemistry **I**nterface (**SPyCCI**) Python pakage. The philosophy of this software package is that of providing the user with a simple unified interface to run computational chemistry calculations across multiple computational chemistry software backends. **SPyCCI** is more than a simple automation tool for the computational chemistry practitioner but rather a package aspiring to be a universal interface for routine calculations, high-trhoghput screenings, property calculations and methods benchmarking. **SPyCCI** not only gives to the user a convenient interface for using computational chemistry softwares but also provides the user with automated functions and workflow to manipulate molecules and compute properties and observables.

## A bit of History

SPyCCI is the result of the collaborative effort of [Pierpaolo Pravatto](https://github.com/ppravatto), [Luca Babetto](https://github.com/lbabetto), and [Marco dalla Tiezza](https://github.com/AresValley). The library was conceived as an independent project, building upon two foundational contributions: [**GES-comp-echem**](https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-comp-echem), co-developed by Pierpaolo and Luca, and [**CoCCA**](https://github.com/TheoChemPhDPadova/CoCCA), an open-source library developed by Marco and Pierpaolo during their PhD at the University of Padua.

SPyCCI not only unites the ideas of these two projects, but continuously improves their integration. The library is actively maintained and updated, with a strong focus on developing new composite algorithms, cheminformatics protocols, and innovative tools for molecular modeling.
