The Simple Python Computational Chemistry Interface (SPyCCI) provides a simple interface for carrying out computational chemistry calculations with a number of computational chemistry programs. The library provides a wide variety of tools and workflows designed to help the scientist in running complex calculations from a compact and easy-to-use Python script.

SPyCCI is an open-source project (distributed under the GNU-GPL3 license) born from the fusion of two independent open-source projects:
* The [GES-comp-echem](https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-comp-echem) library
* The [CoCCA](https://github.com/TheoChemPhDPadova/CoCCA) collection of python tools
